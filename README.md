# Community Support

This is an unofficial repo.  This is an unoffical experiment in
delivering exmple projects to answer specific questions in Community.
Please refer to the thread which will be referenced in the project
readme for context and link to the thread, since this location may
change.  I'll keep the links in the thread current.

With that said, this is how you can integrate this repo into Studio's library of examples:

Open Simplicity Studio Preferences: there should be a Prefereces button somewhere in the top set of toolbars

In the resulting dialog, ecpand "Simplicity Studio", select "External Repos" and click "Add".

From this page, click "Code" button, select "HTTP" tab, then click copy icon

Copy URL into Studio dialog, then click "Next".  The "Name" field should autofill.

Confirm your intent to clone the repo into Studio.  It should be possible to just point at an existing local clone of the repo, but that is a game for another day.  (It appears to be a necessary, but not sufficent step to add ".git" to the path generated from "Browse".  Clearly the path must be prefixed by some URI, but what?)

There are no interesting branches, just click "Finish".

The repo should now appear in the listing.  If looking for a proct which does not appear in Studio, it is probably nescessary to "Update".  Some repos appear to automatically update, user repos added appear not to.  Click "Apply and Close".

Selecting a debug adapter in Launcher perspecive, selecting "EXAMPLE PROJECTS AND DEMOS" tab, scrolling to bottom, the repo name should appear.  Cuurently there is only 1 project targeted at EFR32BG22 / BGM220 and the related radio boards BRD418[234][AB], and BRD431[02]A.
